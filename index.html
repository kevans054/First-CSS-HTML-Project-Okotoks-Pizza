                <h2>Who we are</h2>
                <p>There are no short cuts when it comes to our passion. We pull out all the stops, 
                giving you the ‘wow’ flavour, experience and consistency you not only want, 
                but deserve. Our customers keep coming back, again, again, and again.
                We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in 
                Okotoks, Alberta. When we’re not scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) 
                for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, we’re crafting perfect 
                pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. From hot Hawaiians and classic Canadians
                to crispy wings and decadent fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks Pizza is
                baked with love.</p>
                
                <p>After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, 
                Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. Opening 
                the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, 
                traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more 
                modern and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go.</p>
                
                <p>Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma 
                tomatoes, made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso 
                Pepperoni, salami from Valbella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about 
                ordering it. You feel good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing we're 
                always ready to make you more.
