    These are layout rules, they shape where the content on the page is placed. I would start by changing other easier blocks.
    You will notice some blocks start with the # character, these are looking for tags in our HTML file that have the corresponding "id" that follows the #
    For example, this block applies the layout rules to the tag in our HTML file that has the page-container id

/* 
    These are the simple CSS blocks and rules. They are changing things like the font color,  the font family and how the text is being aligned
    All of these things are common things to manipulate in a word document. Try changing to a different font or color. Maybe try aligning the text differently.
    There are TONS of different CSS rules that can be applied. See if you can do something funky like rotate the h1 tags or something of that nature.

    These blocks and rules below are a bit more advanced and have to deal with the secrets I have sprinkled throughout the site
    We will learn about how all of these work, but if you would like try to understand how they are working.
