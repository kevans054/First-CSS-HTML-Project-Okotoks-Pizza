    <div id="About-Us">
        <p>There are no short cuts when it comes to our passion. We pull out all the stops,
        <br>giving you the ‘wow’ flavour, experience and consistency you not only want,
        <br>but deserve. Our customers keep coming back, again, again, and again.
        <br>We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in 
        <br>Okotoks, Alberta. When we’re not scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) 
        <br>for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, we’re crafting perfect 
        <br>pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. From hot Hawaiians and classic Canadians
        <br>to crispy wings and decadent fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks Pizza is
        <br>baked with love.
        <br>
        <br>After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, 
        <br>Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. Opening 
        <br>the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, 
        <br>traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more 
        <br>modern and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go.
        <br>
        <br>Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma 
        <br>tomatoes, made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso 
        <br>Pepperoni, salami from Valbella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about 
        <br>ordering it. You feel good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing we're 
        <br>always ready to make you more.
